/**
 * <p>The facade package provides high-level abstractions and simplified interfaces for the Keel framework.</p>
 * <p>This package contains facade classes that hide the complexity of underlying implementations and provide</p>
 * <p>easy-to-use APIs for common operations. It includes:</p>
 * <p>- Configuration management utilities</p>
 * <p>- Asynchronous operation mixins</p>
 * <p>- Instance management and lifecycle control</p>
 * <p>- Testing utilities and test framework components</p>
 * <p>The facade pattern is used to provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem,</p>
 * <p>making the subsystem easier to use and understand.</p>
